## Technologies - React, TypeScript & Styled Components.

## React:

React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs). Developed by Facebook, it enables developers to create reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes. React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing the changes applied to the actual DOM, allowing for fast and responsive user experiences.

## TypeScript

TypeScript (TS) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript by adding static types. It allows developers to specify types for variables, functions, and other structures, which helps catch errors during development and improves code readability and maintainability.

## Styled Components

Styled Components is a library for styling React applications using tagged template literals. It allows developers to write actual CSS within their JavaScript, which helps create styled components that are scoped to the component itself. This approach enhances modularity and maintainability.
